- 👋 Hi, I’m @LupusParsec (Uris Herialos)
- 🇧🇷 &#127463 &#127479 I'm 23 and I'm from Brazil.
- 🧠 I already have some knowledge in: HTML4/5, ASP.NET (+Ajax), CSS3, PHP7, SQL, JavaScript (+jQuery), C++, C#, ActionScript. Sadly, I don't remember most of it due a personal trauma with programming.
- 🤦‍♂️ Please, don't judge me about any problem you could have with me. I've Asperger and I'm having a psychological treatment right now for Depression 'n' Anxiety.
- 👀 I’m interested in modding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (or trying to learn it, at least).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I don't know, anything I think I can, maybe...
- 📫 How to reach me... It's complicated. I'm a shy and antysocial pearson. Also, the internet now days make me unconfortable and drives me nuts.
